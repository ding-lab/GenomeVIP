Customized Usage
################

GenomeVIP's server and runtime environments can be customized, updated, or extended. Some examples of how users might customize its usage are list below.

- Execution profiles from a previous computation may be modified prior to uploading to the
  server during job configuration. In this way, altering specific numerical values or datafile
  paths can be accomplished quickly directly instead of locating the corresponding settings in
  the interface. This approach may be helpful to users who wish to import tool parameter
  settings from other pipelines into GenomeVIP.

- Users can alternatively specify the location of custom annotation or filtering VCFs that are
  accessible to GenomeVIP via public FTP/HTTP/HTTPS or the user's/public Amazon S3 cloud
  storage location. This option is very convenient because neither server nor runtime image
  modification is required.
